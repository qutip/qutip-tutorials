    "Everything inbetween the ```\"\"\"...\"\"\"``` is called a **docstring** and it gives a tells someone who is not familiar with a partiular functions a detailed explaination as to what the function does, what parameters it takes as inputs, and what values it returns.  It is also good practice to put some comments next to your local variables so the user knows what each of these is for. Although it seems like a lot of work at first, writing docstrings will make you a much better programmer in the future."
