    "## Motivation\n",
    "A `Qobj` is a generic quantum object, but it only represents constant objects.  When we need to represent time-dependent objects, the relevant functions take a list of `(Qobj, <time-dependence>)` tuples, where the time dependence is a function, a string or an array.  Inside the function, this is then converted into a new, time-dependent class `QobjEvo`.  We then use this for several compilation and optimisation steps to ensure that the solvers run quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not _need_ to use `QobjEvo`, but if you are planning to reuse some large operators for a long-running integration, you can instantiate one yourself and manually call the C compilation methods.  This will have a one-off start-up cost of a couple of seconds, but will make all uses of it faster afterwards.  This trade-off is often worthwhile if the integration will take over around 15 minutes, even if you do not reuse the object."

    "## Instantiation\n",
    "\n",
    "`QobjEvo` is instantiated with the same time-dependent list that is passed to, say, `mesolve`.  This doesn't even _have_ to be time dependent, but constant ones will not have significant benefits over varying ones.  The three types of scalar time dependence are:\n",

    "  - array\n",

    "$$\n",
    "A(t) = \\sum_k f_k(t) A_k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where the $f_k(t)$ are time-dependent scalars, and the $A_k$ are constant `Qobj` objects.  The list then looks like\n",
    "```\n",
    "[A0, [A1, f1], [A2, f2], ...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "where all the `Ak` are constant `Qobj`s, and the `fk` are time dependences in one of the available forms.\n",
